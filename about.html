        <p>Utensils are a small hand held tool used for food preparations
            <br>Used for common kitchen tasks like cutting food items to size
            <br>heating food,baking,grinding,mixing,blending,and measuring
            <br>Diffent utensils are made for each task
            <br>Other kitchen utensils are highly specialized and may be used
            <br>only in connection with preparation of a particular type of food
            <br>Some specialized utensils are used when an operation is to be
            <br>repeated many times,or when the cook has limited mobility
            <br>The number of utensils in a household kitchen varies with time and style of cooking.
